# Basic Forward Contract
This is a C++ implementation of a basic forward contract, which calculates the fair value of the contract. A forward contract is a financial derivative that obligates the buyer to purchase an asset (underlying asset) at a future date and at a predetermined price (forward price). The fair value of the forward contract represents the current worth of the contract.
